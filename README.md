The recipes web app 

This project will demonstrate the skills acquired 
through following the Odin Project's curriculum as a
 measure of learning through developing of a recipes 
 web application. The major problem this project is 
 solving is helping people with free resources of simple 
 sample recipes for a variety of meals.
